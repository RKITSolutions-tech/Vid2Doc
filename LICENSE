Copyright (c) 2025 Ryan Kenning

Preamble

This license grants permission to use, copy, and modify the software provided
that the following conditions are met. The goal of this license is to keep
the Project and any extensions open and freely available for non-commercial
use, and to ensure that improvements and extensions are shared under the same
terms.

Terms and Conditions

1. Non-Commercial Use Only
	- The Software and any Derivative Works (defined below) may not be sold,
	  licensed for a fee, sublicensed for commercial use, or used in a
	  commercial product or service without the express written permission of
	  the Copyright Holder. Any distribution that directly or indirectly
	  results in commercial gain is prohibited.

2. Derivative Works and Extensions (Reciprocity / Share-Alike)
	- "Derivative Works" means any modification, adaptation, translation,
	  extension, plugin, integration, or other work that is based on or
	  derived from the Software.
	- If you distribute, publish, or otherwise make available a Derivative Work
	  of the Software (including extensions, plugins, or improvements), you
	  must do all of the following:
	  a) License the Derivative Work under the exact same license terms as
		  this VNCRL; and
	  b) Make the complete corresponding source code of the Derivative Work
		  available to the recipients under the same VNCRL terms (for example,
		  by providing a public repository URL or including the source with the
		  distribution); and
	  c) Retain, in the source distribution, all original copyright notices
		  and a copy of this license.

3. Attribution
	- Redistributions of the Software or Derivative Works in source or binary
	  form must retain a visible attribution to the Copyright Holder and a
	  copy of this license.

4. No Additional Restrictions
	- You may not impose further legal or technical restrictions on the
	  recipients' exercise of the rights granted by this license. In
	  particular, you may not relicense Derivative Works under terms that are
	  less permissive with respect to source availability and non-commercial
	  use.

5. Termination
	- Any attempt to sublicense, sell, or otherwise commercially exploit the
	  Software in violation of Section 1, or any failure to comply with the
	  obligations in Section 2, terminates the rights granted to the
	  non-complying party under this license.

6. Patent Rights
	- Contributors grant no patent license by this document. If you believe a
	  contributor has granted a patent license, consult the contributor in
	  writing for clarification.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
	- THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
	  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
	  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

8. Limitation of Liability
	- IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
	  CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
	  TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
	  SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

9. Enforcement and Legal Advice
	- This is a custom license drafted to reflect the Project owner's intent to
	  require non-commercial use and to require that derivatives be published
	  under the same terms. License language can have legal implications; the
	  Copyright Holder strongly recommends consulting a qualified attorney to
	  review and, if necessary, refine this text for enforceability in your
	  jurisdiction.
