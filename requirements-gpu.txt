# Optional GPU / CUDA-specific packages for users with NVIDIA drivers and CUDA
# NOTE: These packages are intentionally kept out of the default requirements.txt
# because they are platform- and CUDA-version-specific and will often fail to
# install on CPU-only systems or CI runners without matching drivers.

# Install PyTorch with the correct CUDA support using the official instructions:
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Example (CUDA 12.1):
#   pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 torch torchvision --upgrade

# Optional NVIDIA runtime wheels (example pins used by some environments).
# Only install these if you know your system CUDA version and drivers match.
#nvidia-cublas-cu12==12.1.3.1
#nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12==12.1.108
#nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.2.26

# Optional GPU-accelerated libraries
triton==2.3.1
# faiss-gpu (install the appropriate wheel for your platform/CUDA version)
# PyNvCodec / VPF (optional, binary distribution varies by platform)

# NOTE: Do NOT install this file on CI unless you are running on a GPU-capable
# self-hosted runner. Keep the default CI and developer installs to the
# CPU-compatible `requirements.txt` to avoid long installs and failures.
